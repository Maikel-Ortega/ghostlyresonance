  - I remember O'Hara's always doing stuff on the attic.
  - He put up those bells, and used to play them. It was a certain song, I'm sure.
  - Only four chimes sounded, but I can't remember most of them.
  - The only sound I'm sure I remember is that of the broken chime.
  - It's wounded tune sounded only once. I'm sure of that.
