  - Welcome to our humble hotel stranger.
  - A sad story and a treasure hides between its walls.
  - You will find several guests around the hotel...
  - '...or what remains of them. '
  - They all died on that terrible week, years ago...
  - I lure them here, to find the way to the treasure...
  - '...'
  - Words can't express how miserable I feel, even after dead.
