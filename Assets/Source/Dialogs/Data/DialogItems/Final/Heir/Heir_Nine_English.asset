  texts:
  - I still feel the cold. That deadly bite in my skin...
  - Before I died I stopped feeling anything... I couldn't even think clearly.
  - That manager... I thought him my friend... But he left me stuck out here, at the
    mercy of the elements.
  - He wanted to know about the bells... Maybe he got angry because I didn't tell
    him what my granpa said...
  - Didn't told him the second bell is the same as the first one...
