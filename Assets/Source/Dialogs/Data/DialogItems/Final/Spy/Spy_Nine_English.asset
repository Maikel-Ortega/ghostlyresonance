  - The sweet young heir... Elisabetta...
  - To think that someone that lovely could share the same genes as that O'Hara thief...
  - I needed to learn what she knew about the bells. About the combination to find
    that treasure in the attic.
  - But I fell for her... What a shame. What a pitiful professional...
  - I still only know about the first bell you need to chime...
